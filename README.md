We are currently in the Pre-Alpha stage of our project. This project runs using a
MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), MongoDB may be removed in later 
iterations as it is currently not needed. 

Front-End
With the use of Express, React and Node, this project runs a web-app with a 
few simple skeleton of some pages. These pages are meant as an early draft
for sharing with The Reed Lab as we determine what features will make it 
into the final draft and the procedure that will define trials.
